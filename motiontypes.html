              <h3>Periodic Motion</h3>
              A motion which repeats itself identically after a fixed interval of time is called periodic motion.
              <br>e.g., orbital motion of the earth around the sun, motion of arms of a clock, motion of a simple pendulum etc
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Oscillatory Motion</h3>
              Oscillatory motion is defined as the to and fro motion of the body about its fixed position. Oscillatory motion is a type of periodic motion.
              <br>Ex - vibrating strings, swinging of the swing etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Circulatory Motion</h3>
                When an object moves on a circular path with constant or uniform speed, it is said to have uniform circular motion. 
               <br>Ex - motion of hands of a clock, motion of moon revolving around the earth
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Rectilinear Motion</h3>
                If the motion of a body is along a straight line, it is said to be the rectilinear or linear motion. 
                <br>Ex - the motion of an arrow from a bow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Curvilinear Motion</h3>
                The motion of a particle or object moving along a curved path is called curvilinear motion. 
                <br>Ex - Throwing paper airplanes, motion of a snake, motion of a basketball into the basket
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h3>Translatory Motion</h3>
                  The motion in which all the particles of a body move through the same distance in the same time is called translatory motion. There are two types of translatory motions: rectilinear motion; curvilinear motion.
                  Ex -  of translatory motion are: A running boy, moving bus, walking cat running train
